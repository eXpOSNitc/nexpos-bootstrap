# NexpOS Bootstrap

This repository contains a shell script to download the latest versions of the
components used in NexpOS development. 

A Makefile is also provided to compile them all in one go.

# Instructions

Copy the following snippet to your terminal and press enter.

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eXpOSNitc/nexpos-bootstrap/main/download.sh | sh

This should download all the necessary components ready for compiling.

Then you can run `make` to compile them.
